Well, I was asked whether I could redesign the original teyes website or at least the main webpage. I worked on it for days with low spec pc in winter of 2023 in my 10th or 9th grade, I cant remember. I had to face lots of errors and as you can see there are plenty of errors and site isnt even compatible with any other displays other than the one I used to make with. I think I will someday complete the project once i have enough time and motivation.
